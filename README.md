# BIG-DATA-ANALYTICS 
Aim of the project is to develop a tool for Big Data Analytics using Py-CUDA.Three models â€“ KNN, XGBooster and RandomForest were used for the classification of the data and the results were compared. Each model is trained with the training data. After training, when new set of data when given as input to the model it is classified and the label is predicted.
